# Melody_Metrics_Hub
This project creates a dashboard within Excel for data based for songs from https://www.kaggle.com/code/varunsaikanuri/spotify-data-visualization. 

## Data Insights Chosen

1. Top Most Popular Songs
2. Popular Genres
3. Number of Song Releases per Year
4. Explicit Ratings

The use of slicers reveals the real use case of the insights-- to analyse artists, as well as yearly changes to tastes of people, such as length of popular songs over time (showing socially acceptable and tolerance of audiences towards the music).

## Files

1. Dashboard Image: This stores an image of the dashboard when the excel file is used
2. songs_normalise: This is the excel file used. The dashboard is stored within the 'Dashboard' sheet, the raw data is present in the 'songs_normalise' sheet and the rest of the sheets are helper sheets used to ensure the running of the dashboard.
